          <p class="main_para">When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had been a
            while for me, but I wanted to join my friend for a non-caffeinated
            beverage at Bytes and I became reaquainted with the combination of
            fizzy water and artificial fruit syrup. Italian sodas are not so
            sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a flavored carbonated
            water. The Italian sodas at Bytes also have no cream in them
            (or maybe they do if you ask; I haven't tried), which makes
            it a nice coffee shop alternative for the times when you're
            feeling a refreshing drink that doesn't have caffeine or milk.

          <a class="main_anchor" href="https://goo.gl/maps/3jHRC2umZCy">456 Cambridge Ave, Palo Alto, CA</a>
          <p class="main_para">When your boba craving strikes, head over to Pop Tea Bar, a cute little bubble 
            tea shop on Cambridge Avenue. The menu is your standard bubble tea fare with 
            nothing too adventurous on the menu -- no bubble tea floats, 
            for example -- but the tapioca is fresh, the service is fast, and the tea is 
            smooth and delicious! They have little bites to eat too, like popcorn 
            chicken and eggrolls, in perfect snack-size portions. There's not too much 
            seating, but there's a cute outdoor area in the back for warmer days.
          </p>
          <p class="main_recomm""><strong style="recomm_style">Recommendation</strong> Classic Milk Tea with tapioca + an order of popcorn chicken.</p>

          <p class="main_para">I can't tell you whether CoHo has a particularly amazing 
            Vanilla Bean Latte, only because CoHo is the only place I've ever ordered a 
            Vanilla Bean Latte from. I'm not even totally sure I know what a 
            Vanilla Bean Latte is supposed to taste like. What I do know is the Vanilla Bean 
            Latte I ordered on a whim from CoHo was delicious.

          <a class="main_anchor" href="https://goo.gl/maps/WzJZx183auA2">318 Campus Drive, Stanford, CA</a>
          <p class="main_para">Nexus Cafe has a lot of tasty things packed into its cafeteria space, including agua 
            fresca! Grab a cup of this fresh and fruity beverage before you head to the 
            check out line. Nexus Cafe has plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, too, so on 
            the next sunny day, take a break on the patio with a cup of agua fresca, and 
            maybe a burrito.
